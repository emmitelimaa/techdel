                Based off of Bechdel Test, or Bechdel-Wallace Test, is a simple
                test which names the following three criteria: (1) it has to
                have at least two women in it, who (2) who talk to each other,
                about (3) something besides a man.
              </p>
              <p>
                A Techdel Test, is a method of measuring the influence and
                impact that folks who identify as women+ have on a codebase. To
                pass the test, (1) Two separate women+ engineers have to write
                to different functions or methods in production code. (2) These
                functions or methods call each other
